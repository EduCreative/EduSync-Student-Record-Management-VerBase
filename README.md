## 🚀 Setup and Installation

This project is configured to run with a modern frontend toolchain (Vite) and connect to a Supabase backend.

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account (free tier is sufficient)
- A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### 2. Supabase Configuration

1.  **Create a new Supabase Project:**
    - Go to your Supabase dashboard and create a new project.
    - Save your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**.

2.  **Set up the Database Schema:**
    - Navigate to the "SQL Editor" in your Supabase project.
    - Run the SQL scripts required to create the tables (`profiles`, `schools`, etc.).
      *(Note: A `schema.sql` file should be provided with the project for this step).*

3.  **Configure Storage (for Avatars/Logos):**
    - Go to the "Storage" section.
    - Create a new public bucket named `avatars`.
    - Create another public bucket named `logos`.
    - Set up the necessary RLS (Row Level Security) policies to allow authenticated users to upload/view files.

### 3. Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd edusync-student-record-management-verbase
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your Supabase credentials to this file:
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY
    ```
    - The `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` file is already configured to read these variables.

### 4. Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by Vite (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
